# Enterprise-Network-Design-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This project implements a secure and scalable enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer with VLANs, OSPF, NAT, VPN, and security protocols. Key features include Inter-VLAN Routing, DHCP, NAT Overload, ACLs, IPsec VPN, SSH, and WLAN. The project ensures efficient, secure, and high-performance networking.
 <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h2>
 <p> Yashoda Health Services is a well-established health provider in Hyderabad, offering comprehensive health solutions and services to its clients. The institution operates in two locations within the same city, with the hospital headquarters located 20 km away from the branch hospital in Hyderabad. The headquarters comprises the following departments: Medical Lead Operation & Consultancy Services (MLOCS), Medical Emergency and Reporting (MER), Medical Records Management (MRM), Information Technology (IT), and Customer Service (CS). The branch hospital was designed to share the workload with the headquarters and includes the following departments: Nurses & Surgery Operations (NSO), Hospital Labs (HL), Human Resource (HR), Marketing (MK), and Finance (FIN). Each location is also equipped with a Guest/Waiting Area (GWA) for patients and visitors.</p>
